/*
 * Quiescent state based reclamation
 * =================================
 *
 * QSBR is a safe memory reclamation algorithm for lock-free data
 * structures such as a qp-trie.
 *
 * When an object is unlinked from a lock-free data structure, it
 * cannot be free()d immediately, because there can still be readers
 * accessing the object via an old version of the data structure. SMR
 * algorithms determine when it is safe to reclaim memory after it has
 * been unlinked.
 *
 * With QSBR, reading a data structure is wait-free. All that is
 * required is an atomic load to get the data structure's current
 * root; there is no need to explicitly mark any read-side critical
 * section.
 *
 * QSBR is used by RCU (read-copy-update) in the Linux kernel. BIND's
 * implementation also uses some ideas from EBR (epoch-based reclamation).
 * The following summary is based on the overview in the paper
 * "performance of memory reclamation for lockless synchronization",
 * (http://csng.cs.toronto.edu/publication_files/0000/0159/jpdc07.pdf).
 *
 * Aside: This QSBR implementation is somewhat different from the one
 * in liburcu, described in the paper "user-level implementations of
 * read-copy update", (https://www.efficios.com/publications/), which
 * contains the amusing comment:
 *
 *	BIND, a major domain-name server used for Internet domain-name
 *	resolution, is facing scalability issues. Since domain names
 *	are read often but rarely updated, using user-level RCU might
 *	be beneficial.
 *
 * A "quiescent state" is a point when a thread is not accessing any
 * lock-free data structure. After passing through a quiescent state,
 * a thread can no longer access versions of a data structure that
 * were replaced before that point. In BIND, we use a point in the
 * event loop (a uv_prepare_t callback) to identify a quiescent state.
 *
 * Aside: a prepare handle runs its callbacks before the loop sleeps,
 * which reduces reclaim latency (unlike a check handle) and it does
 * not affect timeout calculations (unlike an idle handle).
 *
 * A "grace period" is any time interval such that after the end of
 * the grace period, all objects removed before the start of the grace
 * period can safely be reclaimed. Different SMR algorithms detect
 * grace periods with varying degrees of tightness or looseness.
 *
 * QSBR uses quiescent states to detect grace periods: a grace period
 * is a time interval in which every thread passes through a quiescent
 * state. (This is a safe over-estimate.) A "fuzzy barrier" is used to
 * find out when all threads have passed through a quiescent state.
 *
 * NOTE: In BIND this means that code which is not running in an event
 * loop thread (such as an isc_work / uv_work_t callback) must use
 * locking (not lock-free) data structure accessors.
 *
 * Because a quiescent state happens once per event loop, a grace
 * period takes roughly the same amount of time as the slowest event
 * loop in each cycle.
 *
 * Similar to the paper linked above, this QSBR implementation uses a
 * variant of the EBR fuzzy barrier. Like EBR, each grace period is
 * numbered with a "phase", which cycles round 1,2,3,1,2,3,... (Phases
 * are called epochs in EBR, but I think "phase" is a better metaphor.)
 * When entering the fuzzy barrier, each thread updates its local phase
 * to match the global phase, keeping a global count of the number of
 * threads still to pass. When this count reaches zero, it is the end of
 * the grace period; the global phase is updated and reclamation is
 * triggered.
 *
 * Note that threads are usually slightly out-of-phase wrt the global
 * grace period. At any particular point in time, there will be some
 * threads in the current global phase, and some in the previous global
 * phase. There will be no threads in the third phase. Any objects that
 * were detached from the data structure in the third phase can be
 * reclaimed after the start of the current phase, because a grace
 * period (the previous phase) has elapsed since the objects were
 * detached.
 *
 * A phase number can be used by a lock-free data structure (such as a
 * qp-trie) to record when an object was detached. QSBR calls the data
 * structure's reclaimer function, passing a phase number indicating
 * that objects detached in that phase can now be reclaimed
 *
 * In general, there will be several (maybe many) write operations
 * during a grace period. The lock-free data structures that use QSBR
 * will collect their reclamation work from all these writes into a
 * batch per phase, i.e. per grace period.
 *
 * There is some example code in `doc/dev/qsbr.md`, with pointers to
 * less terse introductions to QSBR and other overview material.
