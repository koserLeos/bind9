 *
 * In general, the phases up to and including the next phase transition
 * look like:
 *
 * 1. local phase
 * 2. global phase
 * 3. next phase
 * 1. third phase
 *
 * i.e. some threads are still one behind the global phase, on the same
 * phase that will be cleaned up immediately after the phase transition.
 *
 * This function is called just after a write commits. It's likely that
 * some threads on the global phase (2) are using a version of the data
 * structure from before the write, and they can continue using it while
 * the straggler threads (1) catch up and cause a phase transition.
 *
 * The writer can be one of the straggler threads. If it incorrectly marks
 * cleanup work with its local phase (1), memory will be reclaimed
 * immediately after the next phase transition (when the third phase is
 * also 1), which could be almost immediately when the writer returns to
 * the event loop. This will cause a use-after-free for existing readers
 * (in phase 2).
 *
 * More straightforwardly, we need to be able to queue up reclaim work from
 * a thread that isn't running a loop, which also means this function has
 * to return the global phase.
