ns1 is the root server. It needs to delegate directly to
second-level domains (e.g. "test.example" instead of "example)
because ECS options are not sent to top-level domains.

ns5 is a resolver which can be reconfigured as needed.

ns6 is a resolver which is not configured to use ECS at all.

ns7 is a resolver which is configured to use ECS for certain domains.

ans8 is a python-based responder which logs ECS options it receives
and can be configured to answer in different ways depending on the
query name.
