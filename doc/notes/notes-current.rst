Notes for BIND 9.19.25
----------------------

Security Fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- None.

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added a new statistics variable ``recursive high-water`` that reports
  the maximum number of simultaneous recursive clients BIND has handled
  while running. :gl:`#4668`

- Add two mechanisms to close open log files.  The first is 'rndc
  closelogs'.  The second is 'kill -USR1 <pid>'.  They are intended
  to be used with external log rotation tools. :gl:`#4780`

Removed Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- None.

Feature Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Outgoing zone transfers are no longer enabled by default. An explicit
  :any:`allow-transfer` ACL must now be set at the :any:`zone`, :any:`view` or
  :namedconf:ref:`options` level to enable outgoing transfers. :gl:`#4728`

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- An RPZ response's SOA record TTL was set to 1 instead of the SOA TTL, if
  ``add-soa`` was used. This has been fixed. :gl:`#3323`

Known Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- There are no new known issues with this release. See :ref:`above
  <relnotes_known_issues>` for a list of all known issues affecting this
  BIND 9 branch.
