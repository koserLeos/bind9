Notes for BIND 9.19.16
----------------------

Security Fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- None.

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- None.

Removed Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The 'auto-dnssec' configuration option has now been removed. Please
  use :any:`dnssec-policy` or manual signing instead. The following options
  have become obsolete: :any:`dnskey-sig-validity`,
  :any:`dnssec-dnskey-kskonly`, :any:`dnssec-update-mode`,
  :any:`sig-validity-interval`, and :any:`update-check-ksk`. :gl:`#3672`.

- The ``dialup`` and ``heartbeat-interval`` options have been removed.
  :gl:`#4237`

Feature Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- None.

- Return BADCOOKIE for out-of-date or otherwise bad, well formed
  DNS SERVER COOKIES.  Previously these were silently treated as
  DNS CLIENT COOKIES.  :gl:`#4194`

- The option :any:`inline-signing` can now also be set inside
  :any:`dnssec-policy`. The built-in policies ``default`` and ``insecure``
  enable the use of :any:`inline-signing`. If you set :any:`inline-signing`
  at the ``zone`` level, it overrides the value used set in
  :any:`dnssec-policy`. :gl:`#3677`.

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- None.

- Query-processing latency under load has been improved by reducing the
  uninterrupted time spent by resolving long cached chains of domain names.
  :gl:`#4185`

- Ignore :any:`max-zone-ttl` for :any:`dnssec-policy` "insecure",
  otherwise some zones will not be loaded if they use a TTL value larger
  than 86400. :gl:`#4032`.

Known Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- There are no new known issues with this release. See :ref:`above
  <relnotes_known_issues>` for a list of all known issues affecting this
  BIND 9 branch.
