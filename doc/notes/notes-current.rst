Notes for BIND 9.19.8
---------------------

Security Fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- None.

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- None.

Removed Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Dynamic updates that add and remove DNSKEY and NSEC3PARAM records no
  longer trigger key rollovers and denial of existence operations. This
  also means that the option :any:`dnssec-secure-to-insecure` has been
  obsoleted. :gl:`#3686`

Feature Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- A ``configure`` option ``--with-tuning`` has been removed.  The compile-time
  settings that required different values based on "workload" have been either
  removed or a sensible default has been picked.  :gl:`#3664`

- The option :any:`auto-dnssec` is deprecated and will be removed in 9.19.
  Please migrate to :any:`dnssec-policy`. :gl:`#3667`

- Remove setting the operating system limit (``coresize``, ``datasize``,
  ``files`` and ``stacksize``) from ``named.conf``.  These options should be set
  from the operating system (``ulimit``) or from the process supervisor
  (e.g. ``systemd``). :gl:`#3676`

- On startup, ``named`` will set the current number of open files to maximum
  allowed by the operating system instead of trying to set it to unlimited
  which worked only very briefly on Linux 2.6.28 (and was causing performance
  problems and thus the change was reverted in the kernel). :gl:`#3676`

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Increase the number of HTTP headers in the statistics channel from
  10 to 100 to accomodate for some browsers that send more that 10
  headers by default. :gl:`#3670`

- Copy TLS identifier when setting up primaries for catalog member
  zones. :gl:`#3638`

- Fix an assertion failure in the statschannel caused by reading from the HTTP
  connection closed prematurely (connection error, shutdown). :gl:`#3693`

- The ``zone <name>/<class>: final reference detached`` log message was
  moved from the INFO log level to the DEBUG(1) log level to prevent the
  :iscman:`named-checkzone` tool from superfluously logging this message
  in non-debug mode. :gl:`#3707`

- The new name compression code in BIND 9.19.7 was not compressing
  names in zone transfers that should have been compressed, so zone
  transfers were larger than before. :gl:`#3706`

- When a catalog zone is removed from the configuration, in some
  cases a dangling pointer could cause a :iscman:`named` process
  crash. This has been fixed. :gl:`#3683`

- The ``named`` would wait for some outstanding recursing queries
  to finish before shutting down.  This has been fixed.  :gl:`#3183`

- When a zone is deleted from a server, an key management objects related to
  that zone would be kept in the memory and released only at the server
  shutdown.  This could lead to constantly increasing memory usage for servers
  with a high zone churn. :gl:`#3727`


Known Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- There are no new known issues with this release. See :ref:`above
  <relnotes_known_issues>` for a list of all known issues affecting this
