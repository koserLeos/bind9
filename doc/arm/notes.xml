	  <command>named</command> could crash during recursive processing

	  When recursion is enabled but the <command>allow-recursion</command>
	  and <command>allow-query-cache</command> ACLs are not specified, they
	  should be limited to local networks, but they were inadvertently set
	  to match the default <command>allow-query</command>, thus allowing

	  The serve-stale feature could cause an assertion failure in
	  rbtdb.c even when stale-answer-enable was false. The
	  simultaneous use of stale cache records and NSEC aggressive
	  negative caching could trigger a recursion loop in the

	  A bug in zone database reference counting could lead to a crash

	  Code change #4964, intended to prevent double signatures
	  when deleting an inactive zone DNSKEY in some situations,
	  introduced a new problem during zone processing in which
	  some delegation glue RRsets are incorrectly identified
	  as needing RRSIGs, which are then created for them using
	  the current active ZSK for the zone. In some, but not all
	  cases, the newly-signed RRsets are added to the zone's
	  NSEC/NSEC3 chain, but incompletely -- this can result in
	  a broken chain, affecting validation of proof of nonexistence
	  for records in the zone. [GL #771]

      <listitem>
	<para>
	  <command>named</command> could crash if it managed a DNSSEC
	  security root with <command>managed-keys</command> and the

      <listitem>
	<para>
	  <command>update-policy</command> rules that otherwise ignore the
	  name field now require that it be set to "." to ensure that any
	  type list present is properly interpreted.  Previously, if the
	  name field was omitted from the rule declaration but a type list
	  was present, it wouldn't be interpreted as expected.
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  <command>named</command> now supports the "root key sentinel"
	  mechanism. This enables validating resolvers to indicate
	  which trust anchors are configured for the root, so that
	  information about root key rollover status can be gathered.
	  To disable this feature, add
	  <command>root-key-sentinel no;</command> to
	  <filename>named.conf</filename>. [GL #37]
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  Add the ability to not return a DNS COOKIE option when one
	  is present in the request.  To prevent a cookie being returned
	  add <command>answer-cookie no;</command> to
	  <filename>named.conf</filename>. [GL #173]
	</para>
	<para>
	  <command>answer-cookie no</command> is only intended as a
	  temporary measure, for use when <command>named</command>
	  shares an IP address with other servers that do not yet
	  support DNS COOKIE.  A mismatch between servers on the
	  same address is not expected to cause operational problems,
	  but the option to disable COOKIE responses so that all
	  servers have the same behavior is provided out of an
	  abundance of caution. DNS COOKIE is an important security
	  mechanism, and should not be disabled unless absolutely
	  necessary.
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  Two new update policy rule types have been added
	  <command>krb5-selfsub</command> and <command>ms-selfsub</command>
	  which allow machines with Kerberos principals to update
	  the name space at or below the machine names identified
	  in the respective principals.
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  The new configure option <command>--enable-fips-mode</command>
	  can be used to make BIND enable and enforce FIPS mode in the
	  OpenSSL library.  When compiled with such option the BIND will
	  refuse to run if FIPS mode can't be enabled, thus this option
	  must be only enabled for the systems where FIPS mode is available.

	  The <command>rndc nta</command> command could not differentiate

	  When compiled with IDN support, the <command>dig</command> and the
	  <command>nslookup</command> commands now disable IDN processing when
	  the standard output is not a tty (e.g. not used by human).  The command
	  line options +idnin and +idnout need to be used to enable IDN
	  processing when <command>dig</command> or <command>nslookup</command>

	  When a negative trust anchor was added to multiple views
	  using <command>rndc nta</command>, the text returned via
	  <command>rndc</command> was incorrectly truncated after the
	  first line, making it appear that only one NTA had been

      <listitem>
	<para>
	  <command>named</command> now rejects excessively large

    <para>
      BIND is open source software licenced under the terms of the Mozilla
      Public License, version 2.0 (see the <filename>LICENSE</filename>

    <para>
      The license requires that if you make changes to BIND and distribute
      them outside your organization, those changes must be published under
      the same license. It does not require that you publish or disclose
      anything other than the changes you have made to our software.  This
      requirement does not affect anyone who is using BIND, with or without
      modifications, without redistributing it, nor anyone redistributing
      BIND without changes.

  <section xml:id="end_of_life"><info><title>End of Life</title></info>
    <para>
      The end-of-life date for BIND 9.12 has not yet been determined.
      However, it is not intended to be an Extended Support Version (ESV)
      branch; accordingly, support will end after the next stable
      branch (9.14) becomes available.  Those needing a longer-lived
      branch are encouraged to use the current ESV, BIND 9.11, which
      will be supported until December 2021. See
      <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://www.isc.org/downloads/software-support-policy/">https://www.isc.org/downloads/software-support-policy/</link>
