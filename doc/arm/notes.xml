	  When recursion is enabled but the <command>allow-recursion</command>
	  and <command>allow-query-cache</command> ACLs are not specified, they
	  should be limited to local networks, but they were inadvertently set
	  to match the default <command>allow-query</command>, thus allowing
	  remote queries. This flaw is disclosed in CVE-2018-5738. [GL #309]

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  <command>named</command> now supports the "root key sentinel"
	  mechanism. This enables validating resolvers to indicate
	  which trust anchors are configured for the root, so that
	  information about root key rollover status can be gathered.
	  To disable this feature, add
	  <command>root-key-sentinel no;</command> to
	  <filename>named.conf</filename>.
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  Added the ability not to return a DNS COOKIE option when one
	  is present in the request.  To prevent a cookie being returned,
	  add <command>answer-cookie no;</command> to
	  <filename>named.conf</filename>. [GL #173]
	</para>
	<para>
	  <command>answer-cookie</command> is only available as a
	  temporary measure, for use when <command>named</command>
	  shares an IP address with other servers that do not yet
	  support DNS COOKIE.  A mismatch between servers on the
	  same address is not expected to cause operational problems,
	  but the option to disable COOKIE responses so that all
	  servers have the same behavior is provided out of an
	  abundance of caution. DNS COOKIE is an important security
	  mechanism and should not be disabled unless absolutely
	  necessary.  The <command>answer-cookie</command> option
	  is obsolete as of BIND 9.13.

    <para>
      BIND 9.11 (Extended Support Version) will be supported until at
      least December, 2021.
      BIND 9.11-S (Supported Preview Edition) releases will continue to
      be published in tandem with BIND 9.11 releases until the Supported
      Preview Edition moves to a new branch. This may happen before BIND 9.11
      reaches end of life, but not later. See
