	  There was a long-existing flaw in the documentation for
	  <command>ms-self</command>, <command>krb5-self</command>,
	  <command>ms-subdomain</command>, and
	  <command>krb5-subdomain</command> rules in
	  <command>update-policy</command> statements.  Though the
	  policies worked as intended, operators who configured their servers
	  according to the misleading documentation may have thought zone
	  updates were more restricted than they were; users of these rule
	  types are advised to review the documentation and correct their
	  configurations if necessary.  New rule types matching the
	  previously documented behavior will be introduced in a future
	  maintenance release. [GL !708]

	  When acting as a recursive resolver, <command>named</command> can

	  Two new update policy rule types have been added,

	  When a negative trust anchor was added to multiple views

      BIND 9.11 (Extended Support Version) will be supported until at
      least December, 2021.
      BIND 9.11-S (Supported Preview Edition) releases will continue to
      be published in tandem with BIND 9.11 releases until the Supported
      Preview Edition moves to a new branch. This may happen before BIND 9.11
      reaches end of life, but not later. See
