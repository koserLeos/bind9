Release Notes for BIND Version 9.11.5-S1

Introduction

This is a release of the BIND 9.11 Supported Preview Edition, a special
feature preview branch of BIND which is available to ISC customers.

This document summarizes significant changes since the last production
release on the BIND 9.11 (Extended Support Version) branch. Please see the
file CHANGES for a complete list of bug fixes and other changes, or
CHANGES.SE for a list of changes that have been applied specifically to
the Supported Preview edition.

Download

The latest versions of BIND 9 software can always be found at http://
www.isc.org/downloads/. There you will find additional information about
each release, source code, and pre-compiled versions for Microsoft Windows
operating systems.

Legacy Windows No Longer Supported

As of BIND 9.11.2, Windows XP and Windows 2003 are no longer supported
platforms for BIND; "XP" binaries are no longer available for download
from ISC.

Security Fixes

  * There was a long-existing flaw in the documentation for ms-self,
    krb5-self, ms-subdomain, and krb5-subdomain rules in update-policy
    statements. Though the policies worked as intended, operators who
    configured their servers according to the misleading documentation may
    have thought zone updates were more restricted than they were; users
    of these rule types are advised to review the documentation and
    correct their configurations if necessary. New rule types matching the
    previously documented behavior will be introduced in a future
    maintenance release. [GL !708]

  * named could crash during recursive processing of DNAME records when
    deny-answer-aliases was in use. This flaw is disclosed in
    CVE-2018-5740. [GL #387]

New Features

  * When acting as a recursive resolver, named can now continue returning
    answers whose TTLs have expired when the authoritative server is under
    attack and unable to respond. This is controlled by the
    stale-answer-enable, stale-answer-ttl and max-stale-ttl options. [RT #
    44790]

  * Added support for forwarding queries to Cisco Umbrella servers, when
    built with configure --enable-umbrella. [GL #229]

  * The dnskey-sig-validity option allows the sig-validity-interval to be
    overriden for signatures covering DNSKEY RRsets. [GL #145]

  * The validate-except option specifies a list of domains beneath which
    DNSSEC validation should not be performed, regardless of whether a
    trust anchor has been configured above them. [GL #237]

  * Two new update policy rule types have been added, krb5-selfsub and
    ms-selfsub, which allow machines with Kerberos principals to update
    the name space at or below the machine names identified in the
    respective principals.

Bug Fixes

  * Running rndc reconfig could cause inline-signing zones to stop
    signing. [GL #439]

  * Reloading all zones caused zone maintenance to stop for inline-signing
    zones. [GL #435]

  * Signatures loaded from the journal for the signed version of an
    inline-signing zone were not scheduled for refresh. [GL #482]

  * The rndc nta command could not differentiate between views of the same
    name but different class; this has been corrected with the addition of
    a -class option. [GL #105]

  * When a negative trust anchor was added to multiple views using rndc
    nta, the text returned via rndc was incorrectly truncated after the
    first line, making it appear that only one NTA had been added. This
    has been fixed. [GL #105]

End of Life

BIND 9.11 (Extended Support Version) will be supported until at least
December, 2021. BIND 9.11-S (Supported Preview Edition) releases will
continue to be published in tandem with BIND 9.11 releases until the
Supported Preview Edition moves to a new branch. This may happen before
BIND 9.11 reaches end of life, but not later. See https://www.isc.org/
downloads/software-support-policy/ for details of ISC's software support
policy.
