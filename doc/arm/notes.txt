Introduction

This is a release of the BIND 9.11 Supported Preview Edition, a special
feature preview branch of BIND which is available to ISC customers.

This document summarizes significant changes since the last production
release on the BIND 9.11 (Extended Support Version) branch. Please see the
file CHANGES for a complete list of bug fixes and other changes, or
CHANGES.SE for a list of changes that have been applied specifically to
the Supported Preview edition.

Download

The latest versions of BIND 9 software can always be found at http://
www.isc.org/downloads/. There you will find additional information about
each release, source code, and pre-compiled versions for Microsoft Windows
operating systems.

Legacy Windows No Longer Supported

As of BIND 9.11.2, Windows XP and Windows 2003 are no longer supported
platforms for BIND; "XP" binaries are no longer available for download
from ISC.

Security Fixes

  * There was a long-existing flaw in the documentation for ms-self,
    krb5-self, ms-subdomain, and krb5-subdomain rules in update-policy
    statements. Though the policies worked as intended, operators who
    configured their servers according to the misleading documentation may
    have thought zone updates were more restricted than they were; users
    of these rule types are advised to review the documentation and
    correct their configurations if necessary. New rule types matching the
    previously documented behavior will be introduced in a future
    maintenance release. [GL !708]

  * named could crash during recursive processing of DNAME records when
    deny-answer-aliases was in use. This flaw is disclosed in
    CVE-2018-5740. [GL #387]

New Features

  * When acting as a recursive resolver, named can now continue returning
    answers whose TTLs have expired when the authoritative server is under
    attack and unable to respond. This is controlled by the
    stale-answer-enable, stale-answer-ttl and max-stale-ttl options. [RT #
    44790]

  * named now supports the "root key sentinel" mechanism. This enables
    validating resolvers to indicate which trust anchors are configured
    for the root, so that information about root key rollover status can
    be gathered. To disable this feature, add root-key-sentinel no; to
    named.conf.

  * Added support for forwarding queries to Cisco Umbrella servers, when
    built with configure --enable-umbrella. [GL #229]

  * Added the ability not to return a DNS COOKIE option when one is
    present in the request. To prevent a cookie being returned, add
    answer-cookie no; to named.conf. [GL #173]

    answer-cookie no is only intended as a temporary measure, for use when
    named shares an IP address with other servers that do not yet support
    DNS COOKIE. A mismatch between servers on the same address is not
    expected to cause operational problems, but the option to disable
    COOKIE responses so that all servers have the same behavior is
    provided out of an abundance of caution. DNS COOKIE is an important
    security mechanism, and should not be disabled unless absolutely
    necessary.

  * The dnskey-sig-validity option allows the sig-validity-interval to be
    overriden for signatures covering DNSKEY RRsets. [GL #145]

Bug Fixes

  * Running rndc reconfig could cause inline-signing zones to stop
    signing. [GL #439]

  * Reloading all zones caused zone maintenance to stop for inline-signing
    zones. [GL #435]

  * Signatures loaded from the journal for the signed version of an
    inline-signing zone were not scheduled for refresh. [GL #482]

End of Life

BIND 9.11 (Extended Support Version) will be supported until at least
December, 2021. BIND 9.11-S (Supported Preview Edition) releases will
continue to be published in tandem with BIND 9.11 releases until the
Supported Preview Edition moves to a new branch. This may happen before
BIND 9.11 reaches end of life, but not later. See https://www.isc.org/
downloads/software-support-policy/ for details of ISC's software support
policy.
