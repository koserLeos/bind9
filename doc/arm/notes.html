	<p>
	  There was a long-existing flaw in the documentation for
	  <span class="command"><strong>ms-self</strong></span>, <span class="command"><strong>krb5-self</strong></span>,
	  <span class="command"><strong>ms-subdomain</strong></span>, and
	  <span class="command"><strong>krb5-subdomain</strong></span> rules in
	  <span class="command"><strong>update-policy</strong></span> statements.  Though the
	  policies worked as intended, operators who configured their servers
	  according to the misleading documentation may have thought zone
	  updates were more restricted than they were; users of these rule
	  types are advised to review the documentation and correct their
	  configurations if necessary.  New rule types matching the
	  previously documented behavior will be introduced in a future
	  maintenance release. [GL !708]

	  <span class="command"><strong>named</strong></span> could crash during recursive processing

    <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; ">
<li class="listitem">
	<p>
	  When acting as a recursive resolver, <span class="command"><strong>named</strong></span> can
	  now continue returning answers whose TTLs have expired when the
	  authoritative server is under attack and unable to respond. This
	  is controlled by the <span class="command"><strong>stale-answer-enable</strong></span>,
	  <span class="command"><strong>stale-answer-ttl</strong></span> and
	  <span class="command"><strong>max-stale-ttl</strong></span> options. [RT #44790]
	</p>
      </li>
<li class="listitem">
	<p>
	  <span class="command"><strong>named</strong></span> now supports the "root key sentinel"
	  mechanism. This enables validating resolvers to indicate
	  which trust anchors are configured for the root, so that
	  information about root key rollover status can be gathered.
	  To disable this feature, add
	  <span class="command"><strong>root-key-sentinel no;</strong></span> to
	  <code class="filename">named.conf</code>.
	</p>
      </li>
<li class="listitem">
	<p>
	  Added support for forwarding queries to Cisco
	  Umbrella servers, when built with
	  <span class="command"><strong>configure --enable-umbrella</strong></span>. [GL #229]
	</p>
      </li>
<li class="listitem">
	<p>
	  Added the ability not to return a DNS COOKIE option when one
	  is present in the request.  To prevent a cookie being returned,
	  add <span class="command"><strong>answer-cookie no;</strong></span> to
	  <code class="filename">named.conf</code>. [GL #173]
	</p>
	<p>
	  <span class="command"><strong>answer-cookie no</strong></span> is only intended as a
	  temporary measure, for use when <span class="command"><strong>named</strong></span>
	  shares an IP address with other servers that do not yet
	  support DNS COOKIE.  A mismatch between servers on the
	  same address is not expected to cause operational problems,
	  but the option to disable COOKIE responses so that all
	  servers have the same behavior is provided out of an
	  abundance of caution. DNS COOKIE is an important security
	  mechanism, and should not be disabled unless absolutely
	  necessary.
	</p>
      </li>
<li class="listitem">
	<p>
	  The <span class="command"><strong>dnskey-sig-validity</strong></span> option allows the
	  <span class="command"><strong>sig-validity-interval</strong></span> to be overriden for
	  signatures covering DNSKEY RRsets. [GL #145]

      Preview Edition moves to a new branch. This may happen before BIND 9.11
      reaches end of life, but not later. See
