          A new asynchronous network communications system based on
          <command>libuv</command> is now used by <command>named</command>
          for listening for incoming requests and responding to them.
          This change will make it easier to improve performance and
          implement new protocol layers (for example, DNS over TLS) in
          the future. [GL #29]

          The new <command>dnssec-policy</command> option allows the
          configuration key and signing policy (KASP) for zones. This
          option enables <command>named</command> to generate new keys
          as needed and automatically roll both ZSK and KSK keys.
          (Note that the syntax for this statement differs from the DNSSEC
          policy used by <command>dnssec-keymgr</command>.) [GL #1134]

          NSEC Aggressive Cache (synth-from-dnssec) has been disabled by default
          because it was found to have a significant performance impact on the
          recursive service. The NSEC Aggressive Cache will be enable by default
          in the future releases. [GL #1265]

	  Too many simultaneous pipelined TCP queries could cause
	  resource overuse. We now prevent this by enforcing a limit
	  on the number of simultaneous requests per active connection.
	  This flaw`is disclosed in CVE-2019-6477. [GL #1264]
